# FPS_GAME_UNITY
 In this basic FPS game, the player spawns in a map with blocks. The player can shoot realistic bullets (using assets from the Unity Asset Store), which disappear after a set time. Blocks explode upon impact. Instructions appear at the start and vanish after a few seconds. All mechanics are scripted using Unity.
